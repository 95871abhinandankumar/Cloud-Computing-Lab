**Docker file no change, keep it as it is.


**q2,q3,Dockerfile must be in testfolder

1. Docker build .

command : docker images => will list the docker images.. ( take the image id which is around 4.1 GB)

2. docker run -d -it --name=hadoopContainer -v D:/Coding/Sem5/"Cloud Computing"/Assignment-8:/myfolder 7e49df1fbffc => this is image ID( different for different users)

3. docker exec -it hadoopContainer /bin/bash

inside container 

4. apt-get install vim

** mapper.py, reducer.py, inputfiles etc must be present in testfolder( which is mounted to myfolder)

5 .
hadoop jar /usr/local/hadoop/share/hadoop/tools/lib/hadoop-streaming-*.jar -input /myfolder/input/big.txt -output /myfolder/part_1/output -mapper "python /myfolder/part_1/mapper.py" -reducer "python /myfolder/part_1/reducer.py"


hadoop jar /usr/local/hadoop/share/hadoop/tools/lib/hadoop-streaming-*.jar -input /myfolder/input/big.txt -output /myfolder/part_2/output -mapper "python /myfolder/part_2/mapper.py" -reducer "python /myfolder/part_2/reducer.py"


hadoop jar /usr/local/hadoop/share/hadoop/tools/lib/hadoop-streaming-*.jar -input /myfolder/input/big.txt -output /myfolder/part_3/output -mapper "python /myfolder/part_3/mapper.py" -reducer "python /myfolder/part_3/reducer.py" -combiner "python /myfolder/part_3/combiner.py"


hadoop jar /usr/local/hadoop/share/hadoop/tools/lib/hadoop-streaming-*.jar -input /myfolder/input/big.txt -output /myfolder/part_4/output -mapper "python /myfolder/part_4/mapper.py" -reducer "python /myfolder/part_4/reducer.py"


** output will be in the folder /myfolder/q2Output respectively for other command, open the file ("part-00000") which is present in the  /myfolder/q2Output
